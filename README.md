# HackOHI/O UWP Getting Started Resources

This repository contains source code for a UWP starter project (a quick and easy soundboard app), as well as other resources for developers getting started with UWP for the first time.

For the written resources, check out:
- **GettingStartedWithUWP.md**: This is an absolute beginner's guide to UWP. It contains dev environment set up steps, breaks down the most important files in a simple UWP project, and demonstrates how to get your first UI controls on your page.
-  **SoundboardBlogPost**: This document contains a high level overview of the starter project in this repo, and shows you some of the fun stuff you can do with UWP right away!

The code in this repo is built out into three projects: AnimalSoundboard-Part0, AnimalSoundboard-Part1, AnimalSoundboard-Part2. They are three different phases of the same project, each one building on the next. Each project is thoroughly commented, so go check them out and see what some of the code is doing!
